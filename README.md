# AI-To-Compare-Competitor-Products
We have  a reoccurring task called "competitive cross over".  Basically our distributors will give us a spreadsheet of our competitors work gloves and ask us to fill in the spreadsheet with our comparable gloves.  One we are working on right now is for a large auto manufacturer through a large national industrial distributor .  The spreadsheet is about 200 lines of competitive gloves and will take someone 2-4 hours to fill out.   We are doing maybe 2-3 crossover spreadsheets per week and sometimes the turnaround time request from our distributor is very short, so we have to scramble.

We tried putting the spreadsheet into ChatGPT 4.0 and asking it for Superior Gloves  closest equivalent products.  It did the task but I would estimate is was only about 30-40% correct. By the time you look over it and correct the large number of errors it didn't save any time. Is there a way to train ChatGPT or another AI to do it correctly?  Basically if you know which our competitors gloves model ABC is equivalent to Superior Glove model 123 that applies every time.

Ideally we'd like a tool that would do this automaticallyand we could update as products are added or discontinued.
=============
Creating a solution for the "competitive crossover" task using AI involves building a custom mapping tool powered by a trained AI model and a continuously updated knowledge base. Below is a Python-based approach to implement such a system, leveraging machine learning, fuzzy matching, and external tools like fine-tuned AI models.
Steps to Build the Solution

    Dataset Preparation:
        Create a master mapping dataset of competitor gloves and their corresponding Superior Gloves products.
        Include relevant attributes like product names, descriptions, features, and materials for better matching.

    Model Training (Optional):
        Fine-tune a model like OpenAI's GPT-4 or use a smaller, open-source model (e.g., Hugging Face models) with your mapping data to improve accuracy.

    Automated Matching Tool:
        Develop a Python script using libraries like pandas, fuzzywuzzy, and scikit-learn to match competitor gloves to Superior Gloves products.
        Use exact string matches, fuzzy matching, or a classification model for mapping.

    Knowledge Base Update:
        Create an interface (e.g., a web app) to add, remove, or update mappings easily.

Python Code Implementation

Below is an automated mapping tool using a mix of fuzzy matching and a pre-defined knowledge base.
Install Required Libraries

pip install pandas fuzzywuzzy openai

Code

import pandas as pd
from fuzzywuzzy import process
import openai

# Load your OpenAI API key if using GPT for fallback
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# Load the master mapping dataset
mapping_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Competitor Glove": ["ABC123", "DEF456", "GHI789"],
    "Superior Glove": ["Superior123", "Superior456", "Superior789"]
})

def find_closest_match(competitor_glove, mapping_data):
    """
    Find the closest match for a competitor glove in the mapping data.
    """
    matches = process.extract(competitor_glove, mapping_data["Competitor Glove"], limit=1)
    if matches and matches[0][1] > 80:  # Match confidence threshold
        return mapping_data[mapping_data["Competitor Glove"] == matches[0][0]]["Superior Glove"].values[0]
    return None

def map_gloves(input_file, output_file, mapping_data):
    """
    Map competitor gloves to Superior Gloves based on a master dataset.
    """
    # Load input spreadsheet
    competitor_data = pd.read_excel(input_file)
    competitor_data["Superior Glove"] = competitor_data["Competitor Glove"].apply(
        lambda x: find_closest_match(x, mapping_data)
    )
    
    # Use GPT as a fallback for unmatched gloves
    for i, row in competitor_data.iterrows():
        if pd.isna(row["Superior Glove"]):
            response = openai.Completion.create(
                model="text-davinci-003",
                prompt=f"Find the closest Superior Glove match for the competitor glove: {row['Competitor Glove']}",
                max_tokens=50
            )
            competitor_data.at[i, "Superior Glove"] = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    
    # Save the updated spreadsheet
    competitor_data.to_excel(output_file, index=False)

# Example Usage
input_file = "competitor_gloves.xlsx"  # Input file from distributor
output_file = "mapped_gloves.xlsx"  # Output file to save results
map_gloves(input_file, output_file, mapping_data)

Features of the Code

    Fuzzy Matching:
        Finds close matches in the pre-defined mapping dataset based on similarity scores.

    Fallback to GPT:
        If no match is found in the dataset, it queries GPT-4 to suggest a match based on the glove's description.

    Scalable and Updatable:
        You can regularly update the mapping_data DataFrame as new products are added or discontinued.

    Batch Processing:
        Processes entire spreadsheets of competitor gloves in one go.

Improvements for Accuracy

    Fine-Tune GPT or Open Source Models:
        Use your historical crossover spreadsheets to fine-tune GPT or an open-source model (e.g., BERT) for improved performance.

    Attributes-Based Matching:
        Enhance the mapping by comparing specific attributes (e.g., material, thickness, application) instead of just names.

    Web App for Easy Updates:
        Build a web interface (e.g., using Flask or Django) where users can manually verify and update mappings in real-time.

Future-Proofing

For scaling and integration:

    Host the solution on the cloud (e.g., AWS or Azure).
    Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing mappings.
    Implement APIs to integrate with distributor systems directly.

This approach should significantly reduce the manual effort required for the "competitive crossover" task, improve accuracy, and save time for your team.
